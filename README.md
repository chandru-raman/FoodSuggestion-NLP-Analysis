### Food Suggestion With NLP-Analysis ###

This project develops a comprehensive food-based recommendation system designed to improve health outcomes by analyzing both past and current data. It focuses on key health indicators such as body mass index (BMI), weight trends, and the effects of various dietary choices, providing actionable suggestions to promote healthier lifestyles. By combining historical records with recent data, the system ensures that recommendations remain accurate, relevant, and timely.

The initial data preparation is performed using Excel, where raw datasets undergo cleaning to remove duplicates, correct errors, and handle missing values. This step ensures data reliability and consistency for subsequent analysis. Cleaned data is then structured and stored in a MySQL database, facilitating efficient management and retrieval of past health records and real-time inputs.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are applied to community-level communication data related to diet, exercise, and health habits. Methods such as tokenization, stop-word removal, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling uncover patterns and recurring themes within discussions. Sentiment analysis categorizes opinions into positive, negative, or neutral perspectives on nutrition and lifestyle, while clustering groups conversations into themes like weight-loss diets, protein-rich plans, and balanced nutrition strategies. Topic modeling highlights common health goals such as BMI reduction, muscle gain, or energy improvement.

Python serves as the primary technology for executing NLP tasks, retrieving data from the MySQL database, and performing overall data analysis. Development is supported by tools like Anaconda Navigator and Visual Studio Code, enabling seamless integration of multiple libraries and algorithms to process and analyze the data effectively.

The insights generated are visualized using Power BI, which presents both historical and current data in interactive dashboards. These visualizations illustrate relationships between dietary habits, weight changes, and BMI fluctuations over time. Power BI’s user-friendly interface helps business stakeholders easily understand complex data, identify trends, and make informed decisions based on evidence-driven recommendations. The integration of past and present data ensures that visualizations remain relevant for ongoing health monitoring and strategic planning.

Overall, this project combines key technologies—Excel for data cleaning, MySQL for database management, Python for data retrieval, NLP, and analysis, and Power BI for visualization. It highlights the direct connection between dietary patterns and health indicators, making it suitable for real-time applications in nutrition and health monitoring. The approach turns raw and unstructured data into meaningful insights, supporting healthier lifestyle choices through data-driven recommendations.
